# Child Guardian: Automated Monitoring and Alert Framework
Overview:
In today's digital age, ensuring the safety of our little ones online is more crucial than ever. That's why I poured my passion into developing Child Guardian, a revolutionary system designed to safeguard children's online interactions.

Here's a glimpse into the incredible features:

✉️ Customizable Alert System -> Tailor notifications based on specific criteria. Parents now enjoy a personalized and flexible monitoring experience, reducing the need for manual analysis.

🛡️ Safeguarding with Screenshots -> Added an extra layer of security! If our system detects a suspicious word, it sends an alert message to parents accompanied by a screenshot. Vigilance meets innovation for ultimate peace of mind. 📸🔒

🚨 Real-time Monitoring -> Implemented cutting-edge real-time monitoring capabilities, empowering parents with immediate alerts on their child's online activities. Stay in the know in real-time!
